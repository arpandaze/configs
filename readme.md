# Info

These are the collection of my configuration files, scripts, and list of installed packages.

#### Warning
Only tested on my system with Nvidia GPU and Dual Monitor. So xrandr, xmobar and other display related configs might need to be modified. Vim and Xmonad configs should work fine by default.

## Installation
1) Clone the repository.
2) Copy everything except packages.txt and backgrounds to the home folder.
3) Copy backgrounds to /usr/share/backgrounds

## To Do
* Create an automated installation script.
